Standardized function names
I'm probably gonna be creating a shitload of functions as part of code consolodation, so we should come up with a
standard for naming stuff


Get rid of 'Last stats update: Moo'


done - Finish tmember.php3


Expand function library, consolodate code
Many .php3's use a lot of similar code... we should figure out a way to commonize it


Improve reporting of objects being updated
It'd be nice to use more than just the generic error.inc ... maybe touch a file somewhere
as each section of the update starts


Add the graphs back in


Figure out a better way to rank


Set it up so that pedit and teamedit know what page they were called from and return the user there


Redo pedit so that it gets the choices out of the database instead of hard-coded
Or, we might be able to put all the choice info into one place in php3, but we shouldn't have it spread all
over the place.


Look into using a 'view'/stored query to do the listmode logic instead of doing it in php


Benchmark to see if we should include stuff like email in the ranking tables


online list that proxy analizer's can use
many of the proxy log analizers provide links to stats pages... it would be nice if we had a file somewhere
where we could point those programs at different files... like for when we did the sbI to sbII move

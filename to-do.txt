******** PHP technical stuff ********
o Setup support for HTTP caching (ie: squid)
This will not be anywhere near as easy as it should be, unless we find a way to convert the normal method of
sybase date reporting to a timestamp that php understands so that we can perform arithmetic on it. Also, I think
we'll want to know when all of the tables a .php uses are finished from the update, otherwise there's a good
chance that we'll see people caching error messages, etc. Of course, if we have this info, we should be able to...


o Cache .php output on tally using sybase
Basically, setup the .php scripts so that they can do their own caching. They'll need to be able to tell when the
tables they rely on are being updated, and when they've finished being updated. This will be especially important
for tmembers.php3, which uses just about every table we've got.


o Standardized function names
I'm probably gonna be creating a shitload of functions as part of code consolodation, so we should come up with a
standard for naming stuff


o Expand function library, consolodate code
Many .php3's use a lot of similar code... we should figure out a way to commonize it


o Improve reporting of objects being updated
It'd be nice to use more than just the generic error.inc ... maybe touch a file somewhere
as each section of the update starts


o Redo pedit so that it gets the choices out of the database instead of hard-coded
Or, we might be able to put all the choice info into one place in php3, but we shouldn't have it spread all
over the place.


o Look into using a 'view'/stored query to do the listmode logic instead of doing it in php


******** PHP features ******** 
o Add a method for team participants to request the team password be emailed to them via psummary.php3


o Add the participant history graphs back in


o Set it up so that pedit and teamedit know what page they were called from and return the user there


o online list that proxy analizer's can use
many of the proxy log analizers provide links to stats pages... it would be nice if we had a file somewhere
where we could point those programs at different files... like for when we did the sbI to sbII move


o <tibim> Nugget94M: on stats for the overall daily rate... you should use
          the little arrows that you use to show if an email went up or down
          in the ranks, except use it to show how many more mkeys/sec we were
          slower or faster than the previous day.
  <Nugget94M> hmmm.  that's a neat idea.

[12:31pm][Rayden242->] I had an idea for another stat on the main page... If we had been going at our current rate since the begining, it would have taken us x days to get where we are today


o 'Team friends' (http://n0cgi.distributed.net/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1186)

o Percentile ranking (http://n0cgi.distributed.net/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1228)

o HDML stats server.

o List past team allocations in pedit or on a secure psummary page

o 1745: add state/session support for password requests

o 924: update php on blower at some point to fix stripslashes bug (i.e. stripslashes(addslashes("''")) = emp
ty string). And also build with gd support.



******** SQL stuff ********
o Convert all the defaults in tables to a pre-defined default (like def0)


o Setup scripts, etc to allow statsfolk to easily create their own mini-version of the stats database. Should
include all the tables, but should only copy a small portion of the data (like 10% of participants, and all the
records related to those participants)


o Design new import system based on 'header tables'


o Decide on how many sets of tables we're gonna use


o Rank history for participants/teams (what rank a person was for each day)

Cows are cool.
Cows are great.

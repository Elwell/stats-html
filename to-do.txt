o Standardized function names
I'm probably gonna be creating a shitload of functions as part of code consolodation, so we should come up with a
standard for naming stuff


o Get rid of 'Last stats update: Moo'


o /secure team editor


o Expand function library, consolodate code
Many .php3's use a lot of similar code... we should figure out a way to commonize it


o Improve reporting of objects being updated
It'd be nice to use more than just the generic error.inc ... maybe touch a file somewhere
as each section of the update starts


o Add the graphs back in


o Figure out a better way to rank


o Set it up so that pedit and teamedit know what page they were called from and return the user there


o Redo pedit so that it gets the choices out of the database instead of hard-coded
Or, we might be able to put all the choice info into one place in php3, but we shouldn't have it spread all
over the place.


o Look into using a 'view'/stored query to do the listmode logic instead of doing it in php


o Benchmark to see if we should include stuff like email in the ranking tables


o online list that proxy analizer's can use
many of the proxy log analizers provide links to stats pages... it would be nice if we had a file somewhere
where we could point those programs at different files... like for when we did the sbI to sbII move
